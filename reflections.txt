i have learn't new html syntax and tags and also to look for information about the instruction set . Learning all the syntax and tags were easy . To choose between choices and various ways to do the same thing or get the output felt difficult . Look for the resources and tags that you need and select the minimum amount of time or codes to get the instructions done which helped me choose between multiple ways to do the same thing without stressing out or taking longer time .
